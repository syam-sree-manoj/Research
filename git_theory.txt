Git keeps track of changes that you make to files and directories
and good in keeping track of text changes that you make.

Git allows you to go back and forth of different version, compare 
etc.

Difference between “GIT PULL” and “GIT FETCH”?
    In the simplest terms, git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge.
    say you have uploaded your project on GIT.Now your team partner is now already working on the same project 
    and he has made some changes into it. So we have two copies of the code.

    1.On GIT which u uploaded.
    2.on your colleague machine with some latest changes.

    Now you told your colleague to get that code from the GIT.

    Scenario 1: He can get that code using GIT PULL

    If he/she use this command then the updated code on local machine will get replace with the code from GIT Repository.

    Scenario 2 : He can get that code using GIT FETCH.

    If he/she use this command then the updated code on local machine will get merged with the code from GIT Repository. 
    So, your colleague won’t loose any work done.

Difference between git clone and git pull?
#######
git init
git remote add origin git://github.com/cmcculloh/repo.git
git fetch --all
git pull origin master
#######
git clone git://github.com/cmcculloh/repo.git
#######
    They're basically the same, except clone will setup additional remote tracking branches, not just master. 
    Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the
    cloned repository (visible using git branch -r), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked 
    from the cloned repository's currently active branch.

    git clone is how you get a local copy of an existing repository to work on. 
    It's usually only used once for a given repository, unless you want to have multiple working copies of it around. 
    (Or want to get a clean copy after messing up your local one...) git pull (or git fetch + git merge) is how you 
    update that local copy with new commits from the remote repository. If you are collaborating with others, it is a 
    command that you will run frequently.
