1. pip3 install mongoengine


In settings.py

2.  from mongoengine import *
    mongoengine.connect(
        db="tools",
        host="localhost"
    ) 

3.
    pip3 install django-rest-framework-mongoengine
    

4.
    sudo pip install mongoengine==0.9   
    with mongoengine 0.10 we can see that /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mongoengine/ will not have django package in it.
